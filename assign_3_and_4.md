## Assignments 3 and 4

This is my page for the third and fourth assignment of my class in data visualization.  

I used this visulization for my critique - https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week  

I selected this visualization because I was very intrigued by the main takeaways presented here. I found this a while ago and it has been stuck in my head ever since. This visualization, while tragic, breaks down some very common myths. We would all agree that animals like tigers and lions and crocodiles are very deadly and probably cause a lot of deaths. No one takes mosquitoes or even considers humans as deadly animals.
