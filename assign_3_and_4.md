## Assignments 3 and 4

This is my page for the third and fourth assignment of my class in data visualization.  

I used this visulization for my critique - https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week  

I selected this visualization because I was very intrigued by the main takeaways presented here. I found this a while ago and it has been stuck in my head ever since. This visualization, while tragic, breaks down some very common myths. We would all agree that animals like tigers and lions and crocodiles are very deadly and probably cause a lot of deaths. No one takes mosquitoes or even considers humans as deadly animals.  

Initially while critiquing this visualization a lot of thoughts came to mind. The first was that the size of the infographic was too large. I had to scroll on my laptop to see the whole thing. Secondly, the scale of the bar chart was misrepresented. The bars for humans and mosquitoes were drawn as boxes under the bar chart to show the enormity of the value of those elements. It took me some time to understand that. Obviously, the pictures were great for engagement and immediately helped me understand the thought that lions and sharks were so insignificant on this chart.   

While critiquing the chart and giving scores, certain improvements struck me immediately. A lot of those categories are irrelavent to the audience and can be clubbed together to decrease the number of elements in the chart. Also, I thought that a vertical bar chart would be a better idea than a horizontal bar chart. The color scheme also seemed a bit strange. There were gradients on each bar that were fulfilling no purpose. That could be removed to make the chart a lot cleaner.  

So for the wireframe, I decided to implement those thoughts. I created a vertical bar chart with just four bars. I decided to set the threshold at 50,000 for each bar. So snakes, humans and mosquitoes got their own bar and all the others were clubbed into one bar. The biggest challenge that I had was to label the bar with the values clubbed together. So I decided to use this wireframe to gather some feedback from my friends and see if I could come up with a better visualization.
