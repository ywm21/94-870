Telling Stories with Data (Fall 2019)

# About Me
Hello! I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. Currently, I'm a graduate student at the Heinz College of Carnegie Mellon, pursuing a master's degree in Information Systems Management. I completed my undergraduate degree from the Dietrich College of Carnegie Mellon in May 2018, with a degree in Statistics and Machine Learning. I hail from Hyderabad, India. I like playing golf, going to the gym and trying out new restaurants in the city. 

# What I Hope to Learn
By taking this course I hope to learn how to design simple yet meaningful visualizations of complex data sets. I hope to understand how to convey the most amount of information about a dataset to my audience through simple visualization techniques. After taking this course, I hope to go beyond bar graphs and pie charts.
