## Final Project Page  

### Outline  

For my final project, I wanted to discuss the global inequalities in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016 by 196 countries. The biggest impact of this agreement was on developing economies that need to burn coal and other fossil fuels to grow their economy and supply energy to a larger population. That is the main issue that I want to examine in this story. One would expect that developing economies would have higher emissions (larger population and higher growth rates) than developed economies. But is that really the case? I am going to examine this from an income level perspective and a regional perspective.

(ADD: A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories.)
