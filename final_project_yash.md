## Final Project Page (Part 1)  

### Outline  

For my final project, I wanted to discuss the global inequalities in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016 by 196 countries to curb the effects of global warming. Each signatory country had to reduce their footprint to achieve a larger goal across the globe. In theory, developing economies need to burn more coal and other fossil fuels to grow their economy and supply energy to a larger population. Thus, one would expect that developing economies would have proportionally higher emissions (larger population and higher growth rates) than developed economies. But is that really the case? I am going to examine this from an income level perspective and a regional perspective.  

(ADD: A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories.)

To develop the aforementioned questions into a story, it is important to give it structure. The **setup** of this story is that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are on the rise. And that makes sense because the global population is growing strongly and the desire for a better lifestyle is fundamental to human rationality. The **conflict** in this story is that developing countries, with larger populations, are responsible for lesser emissions than developed countries, with lower populations. The **resolution** here would be that population is not the main factor that is responsible for emissions, but lifestyle is. Countries with a higher income level tend to pollute a lot more than countries with a poorer population.

### Data  

The data is sourced from ourwoldindata.org, a website that is maintained by the University of Oxford and the Global Change Data Lab. The data found on this website has been sourced from publicly available datasets offered by the World Bank, the Global Carbon Project, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center and the UN. I collected multiple data files from the website and picked out all the parts that are relevant to my story in a new file. The final data file I intend to use has been uploaded to my Github repository (link below).  

Most of my data is from the year 2016, since that's when the agreement was signed. I also have data from 1840 to show the state of global emissions during the Industrial Revolution. Based on the sketches above, I intend to use the data for 3 charts. First, I am going to compare emissions in the 1800s and 2016 to check which countries were industrializing and how bad their emissions were. I will compare this to their share of emissions in 2016. Second, I am going to look at emissions in 2016 from an income perspective. I have data that categorizes each country into a specific social bracket. I want to explore how lifestyle contributes to emissions and the impact it has on a global scale. Finally, I want to explore how population factors into emissions. Logic dictates that the more the people, the higher the emissions. But is that really true? I hope to find an answer to that question as well.

I have four data sources. The first one contains income groups for the year 2016. The second one contains data about annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by year and country. We will filter this to get the numbers for 1840 and 2016. The third dataset contains information about per-capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. I hope to get a more detailed view of the situation using this. Once again, we will use values for the year 2016 only. Finally, I have a simple dataset that contains the population of each country around the world. We will use 2016 population numbers only.
