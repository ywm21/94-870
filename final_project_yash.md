### 1. Outline (Updated for Part II) 

For my final project, I wanted to discuss CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around the globe. The Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016 by 196 countries to curb the effects of global warming. Each signatory country had to reduce their footprint to achieve a larger goal across the globe. Consider the population of developing economy like India: it's over 17% of the world's population. In theory, developing economies need to burn more coal and other fossil fuels to grow their economy and supply energy to a larger population. And as an Indian, I understand the urgency of power generation in my country. Even today, a fifth of India's population (239 million people) does not have access to electricty. In terms of emissions, one would expect that developing economies would have proportionally higher emissions (larger population and higher growth rates) than developed economies. And thus using an agreement like the one signed in Paris to curb emissions caused by developing economies makes sense. But are developing economies like India really responsible for the majority of global emissions?

To develop the aforementioned question into a story, it is important to give it structure. The **setup** of this story is that India holds over 18% of the world's population. And logically, one would expect India or China to have the largest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The **conflict** in this story is that developing countries, with larger populations, are responsible for lesser emissions than developed countries, with lower populations. Clearly, population and growth are not proportional to emissions. The **resolution** here would be that population is not the main factor that is responsible for emissions, but income level is. Countries with a higher income level tend to pollute a lot more than countries with a poorer population. 

The setup, conflict and the resolution are the major elements of the story arc here. The call to action here is that the Paris Climate Agreemnt is unfair to developing countries like India and China which are still making their way to higher income levels and supporting such massive population levels.  

### 2. Inital Sketches  

I have drawn sketches for the three major points of my story arc. Each sketch builds on a certain aspect of the story. I hope to convert these into visualizations for the final deliverable.

### 3. Data  

The data is sourced from ourwoldindata.org, a website that is maintained by the University of Oxford and the Global Change Data Lab. The data found on this website has been sourced from publicly available datasets offered by the World Bank, the Global Carbon Project, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center and the UN. I collected multiple data files from the website and picked out all the parts that are relevant to my story in a new file. The final data file I intend to use has been uploaded to my Github repository (link below).  

Most of my data is from the year 2016, since that's when the agreement was signed. I also have data from 1840 to show the state of global emissions during the Industrial Revolution. Based on the sketches above, I intend to use the data for 3 charts. First, I am going to compare emissions in the 1800s and 2016 to check which countries were industrializing and how bad their emissions were. I will compare this to their share of emissions in 2016. Second, I am going to look at emissions in 2016 from an income perspective. I have data that categorizes each country into a specific social bracket. I want to explore how lifestyle contributes to emissions and the impact it has on a global scale. Finally, I want to explore how population factors into emissions. Logic dictates that the more the people, the higher the emissions. But is that really true? I hope to find an answer to that question as well.

I have four data sources. The first one contains income groups for the year 2016. The second one contains data about annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by year and country. We will filter this to get the numbers for 1840 and 2016. The third dataset contains information about per-capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. I hope to get a more detailed view of the situation using this. Once again, we will use values for the year 2016 only. Finally, I have a simple dataset that contains the population of each country around the world. We will use 2016 population numbers only.

### 4. Method and Medium  

For my final deliverable, I would like to use Shorthand as my medium. I will use the datasets mentioned above and the story outline to create a presentation that will deliver me message in a persuasive manner. I will use Shorthand to create charts for the next part of the project and then get user feedback to improve/edit them.  

The first part of the presentation will be used to build tension. I want to slowly reveal the difference in emissions from 1840 to 2016, thus building some suspense for the audience. I will use animation to achieve this. And when I show the next two charts, I want to reconstruct them so that my logic holds for the entire audience and my call to action is well absorbed. I will do this by showing each continent on the chart one after the other.

### 6. User Research Protocol  

**Target Audience:** The target audience for this story could be anyone. Since it is a global issue, almost anyone will relate to it. While every viewer's opinion about the issue may not be the same, they are all definitely part of the target audience.    

**Identifying Representative Individuals to Interview:** Since this is a presentation about various countries, I would ideally like to interview people from varied nationalities. One individual from a developed country, one from a developing country and one from a low income country. This should give me a wholistic review of my storyboard and a well-rounded opinion about the clarity of the message. Most importantly, I want individuals who have some experience in statistics and data visualization. I want to find out if my charts are able to communicate my ideas and if not, I want some technical feedback on how I can do that. 

**Interview Script:**  
1. Would you characterize your home country as developed, developing or a low-income nation?  
2. Have you studied statistics before? If so, do you have some basic knowledge about data visualization?  
**Show them the storyboard now.**  
3. Do you feel that this presentation does a good job at building a story logically and impactfully?  
4. Did you feel like you were losing interest at any point?  
5. Was the story moving too fast/slow?  
6. Are there any charts you would like to change?  
7. Any other recommendations that you have?  

**Findings from the Interviews:** It is important to keep in mind that with each consecutive interview, I got better at presenting my storyboard, so there can be a difference in how well the presentation was explained between interviewees. Here are some excerpts from each interview:  

1. This interviewee is from a developing country with a large population. The interviewee is a junior from Dietrich College, majoring in Statistics. The interviewee believes that the storyboard does a good job at building the story logically, but the time allocated to the presentation is too short to make any significant impact. The interviewee was not losing interest at any point, but said that things were moving too fast and that he/she didn't get enough time to review the charts. The interviewee also said that population charts have too much content on them and that he/she was barely able to read the axis before I had to move on to the next wireframe. The interviewee recommended that I trim down the content on the population charts.  

2. This interviewee is from a developed country with a very small population. The interviewee is a MISM graduate student at the Heinz College. The interviewee has done several statistics courses during his/her undergraduate education. The interviewee feels that the flow of the story is a bit confusing since, the first 2 wireframes talk about a country, India. But the charts after that talk in terms of continents. This interviewee found the presentation impactful though, especially the last chart. The interviewee was not losing interest through the presentation but found that the story was moving too fast. "There is too much to tell in very little time" said the interviewee. The interviwee recommended that I change the caption of all my wireframes to the main takeaway of that wireframe. I agree with this as it would definitely improve absorption of all the details for all the viewers.  

3. This interviewee is from a low income country with a small population. The interviewee is a senior at Tepper School, majoring in  Business Management. The interviewee is also pursuing a double major in Statistics and has taken courses in data visualization. The interviewee believes that the storyboard is logical and to the point. The interviewee was not losing interest at any point but felt that the presentation was a little fast. "For someone who has background knowledge of the Paris Climate Agreement, this would not be very fast. For everyone else, it is a bit fast", said the interviewee. The interviewee recommended that I mention the Paris Climate Agreement in the introductory slides because he was blindsided when it showed up at the very end. The interviewee also recommended that I present my call-to-action at the start of the presentation and at the end. I agree with this.  

**Changes to Implement:**  Based on the recommendations of the interiewees and my own review, I feel that the following changes would help the presentation to a large extent:  

1. I agree with that the charts need to be trimmed. There is too much content on the charts and I have only about 15 seconds to present all the relevant information. And I read in the Good Charts book that every time someone sees a new chart, they take about 10 seconds to just read the chart and then start listening to what the presenter has to say. So to make it as efficient as possible, here is an example of a revised chart:  

![REV_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ywm21/94-870/master/final_project_files/Revised_1.png)  
Revision of Wireframe 4  

2. And I think I should definitely add the key takeaways of each frame to the caption of the chart. I will incorporate this when I make my final deliverable.  

3. I also think that mentioning the Paris Climate Agreement in the beginning is a good idea. I could just incorporate it into the title slide, along with the call-to-action as I would like to it at the start of the presentation as well as the end.  

4. I have also removed the world map chart where I was trying to show the scale of the population in Asia. I think it's fairly obvious to most people. Removing it will also free up valuable time. And since every interviewee said that the story was too fast, I think this is a much needed revision.  

**Here is a new storyboard outline with the aforementioned changes:**
